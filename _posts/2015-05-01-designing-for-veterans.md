#### Be quiet, respectful and empathetic.

These are the principles of vets.gov. Unlike many projects where it's so easy - required, even - to insert design flourishes aplenty, it was clear early on that vets.gov had to be very different. This effort had to be efficient. Succinct. And at the same time, it needed to not feel impersonal, creating a wall between Veterans and the service they deserve. Most of all, vets.gov can't be another hurdle to overcome.

For now, vets.gov is a small, simple Web site aimed at simplifying the most frequent interactions a Veteran has with VA. It is not complete, exhaustive or definitive. But it is a start in a new direction â€” a very public experiment in how the agency can communicate, going forward.

We're building this with a small team. A few great content strategists and problem solvers, a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and a [designer (me)](http://dannychapman.com). Here's a look at how we're meeting these principles from a design perspective.

#### Be quiet

There are no images. And, [taking a page from gov.uk](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/06/18/retiring-our-icons/), there aren't any icons to distract you. Text, color, and a simple grid provide structure and hierarchy. Whenever possible, content is presented in one column. This way, there's less chance of getting lost, distracted, or confused about what's truly important. Simply read top to bottom, then make your next decision.

#### Be respectful

There are no tricks, nothing to pull your attention from the content that is most important. No sidebar, no widgets. No pop-ups or surveys. Nothing to take your attention away. Content is presented with a simple typeface, designed for the screen.

#### Be empathetic

We understand that veterans.gov content will be used and reused in many different contexts. It will be viewed on computers old and new. It will arrive over dialup connections, slow wireless networks, and broadband. We plan for this by building with Web standards and a mobile-first responsive approach.  We're building simple Web pages that can be easily printed, displayed in an RSS reader or a Twitter Card; or, on a TV screen or a news aggregator. No matter how it's accessed or viewed, it will display with the best of results.

#### Build something empowering and easy to use.

Usability testing has been baked into our design process and will continue to be with every iteration. Nothing tops testing vets.gov with actual veterans. Our plan is to continue to do usability testing as we build. As we have analytics, we'll combine our testing results with data to refine and improve the user experience.


#### We need your help.

As a designer leading the charge on this project, it's been an amazing privilege to work on such a big challenge filled with great purpose. But we can't do it alone, nor should we.

If you're a designer, writer, user experience designer or usability expert, we need your help to make this better. Join us on GitHub and help us provide a level of service to Veterans that we can all be proud of. Got a content edit for us? Found a design problem that needs fixing? We need to hear from you.
