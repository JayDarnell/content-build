I didn't fully understand the mission until I went to Utah.

I'd been working on a web application for the Department of Veteran's affairs for several months at that point, and I'd just flown into Salt Lake City for some usability testing with our testing group. Having not grown up in a military family, my understanding of veterans - what it meant to be one, what it meant to serve — fit neatly into headlines, news reports about either VA or veterans returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan.

That all changes when you walk into a VA facility. You see people that served us. Some doing well, others truly struggling. People that served us is ways that are so humbling, it's hard to confront.

The application I was there to do informal usability testing on had a very simple purpose: to make the process of filling out forms easier for medical examiners. If ever there was an application design that needed to be as efficient, quiet, and mostly stay out of the way, this was it.

Several months later, I was honored to be part of the small team assembled to help build vets.gov. Working with veterans and non veterans alike, we came up with core voice and tone principles that mirrored my experience in Salt Lake. There were a lot of things scribbled on white boards, but the three principles that have stayed with me are these:

#### Be quiet, respectful and empathetic.

Unlike many projects where it's so easy - required, even - to insert design flourishes aplenty, it was clear early on that vets.gov had to be very different. This site had to be incredibly efficient. And at the same time, it was important to not feel impersonal — creating a wall between Veterans and the service they deserve.

For now, vets.gov is a small experiment, aimed at simplifying the most frequent interactions a Veteran has with VA. It is a very long way from being feature complete, exhaustive or definitive. But it is a start in a new direction — a very public experiment in how the agency can communicate, going forward.

We're building this with a small team. A few great content strategists and problem solvers, designers and coders from the [United State Digital Service](https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service), a few [Presidential Innovation Fellows](http://pif.gov), and a [designer (me)](http://dannychapman.com). Here's a how we're attempting to achieve these principles from a design perspective.

#### Be quiet

There are no images. And, [taking a page from gov.uk](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/06/18/retiring-our-icons/), there aren't any icons to distract you. Text, color, and a simple grid provide structure and hierarchy. Whenever possible, content is presented in one column. This way, there's less chance of getting lost, distracted, or confused about what's truly important. Simply read top to bottom, then make your next decision.

#### Be respectful

There are no tricks, nothing to pull your attention from the content that is most important. No sidebar, no widgets. No pop-ups or surveys. Nothing to take your attention away. Content is presented with a simple typeface, designed for the screen.

#### Be empathetic

We understand that veterans.gov content will be used and reused in many different contexts. It will be viewed on computers old and new. There will be dialup connections, slow wireless networks, and broadband. We plan for this by building with Web standards and a mobile-first, responsive approach.  We're building simple Web pages that can be easily printed, shared on social media, read aloud as text-to-speech, or displayed on your cousin's old not-so-smartphone.

#### Build something empowering and easy to use.

Usability testing has been baked into our design process and will continue to be with every iteration. Nothing tops testing vets.gov with actual veterans. We continue to do usability testing as we build. In addition, as our site traffic grows, we plan on combining our testing results with data to refine and inform our user experience.

#### We need your help.

As a designer leading the charge on this project, it's been an amazing privilege to work on such a big challenge filled with great purpose. But we can't do it alone, nor should we.

If you're a designer, writer, user experience designer or usability expert, we need your help to make this better. Join us on GitHub and help us provide a level of service to Veterans that we can all be proud of. Got a content edit for us? Found a design problem that needs fixing? We need to hear from you.
